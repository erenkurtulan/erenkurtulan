 I'm Eren Kurtulan, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at Sakarya University. I have a strong interest in embedded systems, control systems. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects involving microcontrollers, digital control, and automation.

 I have experience with:

Programming Languages: C, Python, MATLAB
Development Environments: Code Composer Studio (CCS), Keil, Simulink/MATLAB.
Microcontrollers: TI Tiva TM4C123G, ADuC841
Embedded Systems Applications: PID control, ADC processing, LCD interfacing, and more
 Here, I share my Tiva TM4C123G microcontroller projects developed using Code Composer Studio (CCS). Each project is well-documented and demonstrates fundamental embedded system applications.Tiva™ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller üzerinden CCS kullanarak yaptığım projeleri ekledim.
